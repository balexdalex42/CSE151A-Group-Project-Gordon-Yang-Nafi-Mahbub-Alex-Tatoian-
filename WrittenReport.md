## Introduction
For this project, we will try to classify asteroids as potentially hazardous (PHA) using the NASA Small Body Database (SBDB) dataset which contains detailed orbital and physical properties of over 958,000 asteroids. We first had to try preprocessing the data to remove irrelevant or noisy features, followed by experimenting with multiple machine learning models we learned in this course. We initially developed a Decision Tree Classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to establish a baseline performance, addressing challenges such as class imbalance and feature selection. We then tried building on these, trying an unsupervised learning approach using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality followed by a K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to enhance prediction accuracy. Our final submission evaluates the performance of all the models we tried, identifies underfitting or overfitting tendencies, and proposes improvements contributing to the goal of accurately identifying hazardous asteroids.
